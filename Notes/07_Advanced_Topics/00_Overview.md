# 7. Advanced Topics

In this section, we look at a small set of somewhat more advanced
Python features that you might encounter in your day-to-day coding.
Many of these topics could have been covered in earlier course
sections, but weren't in order to spare you further head-explosion at
the time.

It should be emphasized that the topics in this section are only meant
to serve as a very basic introduction to these ideas.  You will need
to seek more advanced material to fill out details.
