# 9 Packages

We conclude the course with a few details on how to organize your code
into a package structure.  We'll also discuss the installation of
third party packages and preparing to give your own code away to others.

The subject of packaging is an ever-evolving, overly complex part of
Python development.  Rather than focus on specific tools, the main
focus of this section is on some general code organization principles
that will prove useful no matter what tools you later use to give code
away or manage dependencies.
